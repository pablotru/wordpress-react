    Description: The objective of this project was to develop a functioning hybrid WordPress theme utilizing the WP REST API and ReactJS. Instead of creating a headless ReactJS application (another approach), the application is served through WordPress as a theme allowing PHP variables to be passed to the client-side on render.
